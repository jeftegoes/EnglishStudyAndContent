  - I completely forgot **our** keys.

## 5.4. Possessives 's

- The genitive case is when we add apostrophe S ('s) to show possession, that something belongs to another or a **type of relationship** between things.
- We normally use the 's with people, animals though it can also be used with places, organizations and companies (which suggest a group of people).
- It's not common to use the 's with non-living things.
- With non-living things we say:
  - The pages of the book.
  - The arm of the sofa.
  - The tip of a pen.
