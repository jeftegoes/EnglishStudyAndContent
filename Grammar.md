- When the verb ends in **-ch, -ss, -sh, -x or -zz, we** add **-es**.
  - wash = wash**es**
- When the verb ends in a **consonant** + **-y** we change **y** to **i** and add **-es**.
  - study = studi**es**
- But when the verb ends in a **vowel** + **-y** we just add **-s**.
  - enjoy = enjoy**s**
- In questions we use:
  - **Do** with I, you, we they.
  - **Does** with he, she, it.
- **NEVER SAY: Does he works...?**

  - **Her** skirt is green.
  - **Its** food is tasty.
  - **Our** cats are not at home.

  - Which one of these is **yours**?
  - I completely forgot **our** keys.

## 5.4. Possessives 's

- The genitive case is when we add apostrophe S ('s) to show possession, that something belongs to another or a **type of relationship** between things.
- We normally use the 's with people, animals though it can also be used with places, organizations and companies (which suggest a group of people).
- It's not common to use the 's with non-living things.
- With non-living things we say:
  - The pages of the book.
  - The arm of the sofa.
  - The tip of a pen.

|          | Noun + 's or s' | noun    |
| -------- | --------------- | ------- |
| Singular | Sam's           | bicycle |
| Plural   | Sam and Emma's  | house   |
|          | my parents'     | friends |
|          | my children's   | toys    |
