- Writing and saying the date in English
  - We ask the date or about dates in several ways, for example:
    - What date is it?
      - It's the 19th.
    - What's the date today?
      - It's 19th May.
    - What's today's date?
      - Today is ...
    - When is your birthday?
      - My birthday is April 10th (Tenth).
    - What is your date of birth?
      - I was born on April 10th (Tenth), 1991 (Nineteen Ninety One).
- For dates in spoken English, we always use an **orginal number** for the day.
  - Example: Fourth of July
- There are two ways of saying the date based on British and American English:

  |           | British                                | American                        |
  | --------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
  | Rule      | DAY/MONTH/YEAR                         | MONTH/DAY/YEAR                  |
  | You write | 1st January 2010                       | January 1st, 2010               |
  | You say   | The first of january, two thousand ten | January first, two thousand ten |

- Year normally divided into two parts.
  - 1984 = 19 = nineteen - 84 = Eighty four
- **Exception:** For the years from 2000 to 2010, we normally say **two thousand and + number**
  - Examples:
