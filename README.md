| You     | You    | Your      | Yours       |
| They    | Then   | Their     | Theirs      |

## 3.1. Personal

- Use the **subject** pronoun when acts as the subject of the clause.
- Use the **object** pronoun when it is the object of a verb to receive the action.

| Subject | Object |
| ------- | ------ |
| I       | Me     |
| We      | Us     |
| He      | Hin    |
| She     | Her    |

  - You helped **them** with homework?

## 3.2. Possessive

- Dependent / Independent possessive pronouns:
  - A dependent possessive pronoun needs to be used with a noun.
  - An independent possessive does not need a noun (it takes the place of a noun and add possession).
- Example:
  - **My** car is red.
  - **His** house is big.
  - **Her** skirt is green.
  - **Its** food is tasty.
  - **Our** cats are not at home.
  - **Their** t-shirts aren't black.
  - **Your** parents are in the church.
  - This is **my** pen.
  - Is that bag **hers**.
  - Which one of these is **yours**?
  - I completely forgot **our** keys.

## 3.3. Possessives 's

- The genitive case is when we add apostrophe S ('s) to show possession, that something belongs to another or a **type of relationship** between things.
- We normally use the 's with people, animals though it can also be used with places, organizations and companies (which suggest a group of people).
- It's not common to use the 's with non-living things.
- With non-living things we say:
  - The pages of the book.
  - The arm of the sofa.
  - The tip of a pen.

|          | Noun + 's or s' | noun    |
| -------- | --------------- | ------- |
| Singular | Sam's           | bicycle |
| Plural   | Sam and Emma's  | house   |
|          | my parents'     | friends |
|          | my children's   | toys    |

- Examples:
  - Paul's camera.
  - Bob's car.
  - I go to my mother's house on weekends.
  - I don't like Ana's mother.

  - wash = wash**es**
- When the verb ends in a **consonant** + **-y** we change **y** to **i** and add **-es**.
  - study = studi**es**
- But when the verb ends in a **vowel** + **-y** we just add **-s**.

- There are two ways of saying the date based on British and American English:

  |           | British                                | American                  |

  | You write | 1st January, 2010                      | January, 1st, 2010        |
  | You say   | The first of january, two thousand ten | January (the) first, 2010 |

- Year normally divided into two parts.
  - 1984 = 19 = nineteen - 84 = Eighty four
- **Exception:** For the years from 2000 to 2010, we normally say **two thousand and + number**
