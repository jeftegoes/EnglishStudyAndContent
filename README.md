| He      | His    | His       | His         |

| We      | Us     | Our       | Ours        |
| You     | You    | Your      | Yours       |
| They    | Then   | Their     | Theirs      |

## 3.1. Personal

- Use the **subject** pronoun when acts as the subject of the clause.
- Use the **object** pronoun when it is the object of a verb to receive the action.

| Subject | Object |
| ------- | ------ |
| I       | Me     |
| We      | Us     |
| He      | Hin    |
| She     | Her    |
| They    | Them   |
| You     | You    |
| It      | It     |

- Examples:

  - **She** told **me** the news.
  - **They** took **us** to the park.
  - You helped **them** with homework?

## 3.2. Possessive

- Dependent / Independent possessive pronouns:
  - A dependent possessive pronoun needs to be used with a noun.
  - An independent possessive does not need a noun (it takes the place of a noun and add possession).
- Example:
  - **My** car is red.
  - **His** house is big.
  - **Her** skirt is green.
  - **Its** food is tasty.
  - **Our** cats are not at home.
  - **Their** t-shirts aren't black.
  - **Your** parents are in the church.
  - This is **my** pen.
  - Is that bag **hers**.
  - Which one of these is **yours**?
  - I completely forgot **our** keys.

## 3.3. Possessives 's

- The genitive case is when we add apostrophe S ('s) to show possession, that something belongs to another or a **type of relationship** between things.
- We normally use the 's with people, animals though it can also be used with places, organizations and companies (which suggest a group of people).
- It's not common to use the 's with non-living things.
- With non-living things we say:
  - The pages of the book.
  - The arm of the sofa.
  - The tip of a pen.

|          | Noun + 's or s' | noun    |
| -------- | --------------- | ------- |
| Singular | Sam's           | bicycle |
| Plural   | Sam and Emma's  | house   |
|          | my parents'     | friends |
|          | my children's   | toys    |

- Examples:
  - Paul's camera.
  - Bob's car.
  - I go to my mother's house on weekends.
  - I don't like Ana's mother.

    - **The** book.
    - **The** house.

- With **he/she/it** we add ending **-s** to the verbs.
- When the verb ends in **-ch, -ss, -sh, -x or -zz, we** add **-es**.
  - wash = wash**es**
- When the verb ends in a **consonant** + **-y** we change **y** to **i** and add **-es**.
  - study = studi**es**
- But when the verb ends in a **vowel** + **-y** we just add **-s**.

  - Usually - 80%
  - Often - 70%
  - Sometimes - 50%
  - Rarely - 20%
  - Never - 0%
- **The most common position for adverbs of frequency is between the subject and the verb. As is often the case in English, there are variations to this rule. For example, it's possible to put the adverbs "sometimes" and "usually" at the beginning of a sentence.**

- There are two ways of saying the date based on British and American English:

  |           | British                                | American                  |

  | You write | 1st January, 2010                      | January, 1st, 2010        |
  | You say   | The first of january, two thousand ten | January (the) first, 2010 |

- Year normally divided into two parts.
  - 1984 = 19 = nineteen - 84 = Eighty four
- **Exception:** For the years from 2000 to 2010, we normally say **two thousand and + number**
