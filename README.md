# 4. Adverbs of frequency / Habits / Routine

- An adverb of frequency describes how often an action happens. There are six main adverbs of frequency that we use in English: always, usually (or normally), often, sometimes, rarely, and never.
- Adverbs:
  - Always - 100%
  - Usually - 80%
  - Often - 70%
  - Sometimes - 50%
  - Rarely - 20%
  - Never - 0%
- **The most common position for adverbs of frequency is between the subject and the verb. As is often the case in English, there are variations to this rule. For example, it's possible to put the adverbs "sometimes" and "usually" at the beginning of a sentence.**
